# IS7033 Project - Drug Discovery Model

### Introduction
The [IDG-DREAM Challenge](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn15667962) [1] was created to bring in competitors to design models to predict drug capabilities to provide biomedical scientists some computational insight for valuable targets for further research. The focus of this competition is on drugs that inhibit Kinase protein activity within the biological cell. Kinase proteins main functions are to interact with other molecules (usually proteins) to impact their enzyme activity, location within the cell, or how they interact with other proteins [2].

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.



```python
def foo():
    if not bar:
        return True
```


    def foo():
        if not bar:
            return True
